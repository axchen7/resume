      \item {Provisioned a full-stack web app consisting of static React code, a GraphQL API running on Azure Functions, and a PostgreSQL database.}
      \item {Optimized the performance of infinitely-scrolling cloud documents by designing a tree-like storage format paired with a mechanism to dynamically load/unload subtrees based on browser viewport.}
      \item {Wrote SQL queries by hand (as necessary) to speed up performance-critical tasks and enable complex operations like full-text search within a document subtree.}
      \item {Solved the tricky issue of PDF generation by using headless Chromium instances controlled by Puppeteer, consuming an Azure Service Bus Queue and writing to Azure Blob Storage.}

      \item {Built a 2D interface using Java Swing for editing splines by drag-and-dropping anchors; supports viewport x/y translation and zoom.}
      \item {Utilized by robotics team to rapidly create and test autonomous robot paths.}
      \item {Developed a custom file format based on JSON that stores the minimum representation of a path; format also contained an array of coordinates and curvatures along the path for use with path following algorithm.}
